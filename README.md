## The Social Dynamics around Misinformation Spreading on Social Media

Lecture in the Digital Humanism Series, University of Vienna

Bullet points: 

 -   Emotions do not generally increase irrationality, but have a function (even for misinformation belief)
  -  Beliefs and misinformation sharing are socially motivated, not the result of gullibility
   - Misinformation is a symptom of political polarization, rather than the disease itself
    - Social media and its algorithms reflect political polarization, but are likely not its primary causes
