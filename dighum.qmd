## Overview

-   Emotions do not generally increase irrationality, but have a function (even for misinformation belief)
-  Beliefs and misinformation sharing are socially motivated, not the result of gullibility
- Misinformation is a symptom of political polarization, rather than the disease itself
- Social media and its algorithms reflect political polarization, but are likely not its primary causes

::: notes
time notes and planning

Overview slides, book/article recommendations, last slide (little time, 30 sec): 4
Section title slides (no time required, 15 sec): 6
Normal slides (including 1. title slide): 34 - 9 = 26 normal slides
I presented 26-4=22 normal slides and 4 overview slides in 50 minutes.
- Overview: 4x0.5 minutes = 2 minutes
- 48 minutes for 22 normal slides

Results: 
- 27.5 normal slides = 1 hour. 
- Counting normal and quick slides (26 presented in 50 minutes): 26.4 slides/1 hour
Teaching: 2.2 minutes per normal slide. Rule of thumb: Including quick slides, a bit less than 1/2 as many slides as minutes. If I stick to slide content (no story add ons), then 1 slide 2 minutes is fine.

## Digital Humanism - maybe as conclusion?

- What it means to me
- Talk about the roots of “Digital Humanism” within their disciplinary traditions
- Creating social media in a way that fosters individual and societal well-being
- Many problems
- Challenges: intuition vs. evidence, actual causes of problems, complex issues/systems


## Computational Social Science, Psychology

- Strong theory testing, asking good questions
- strong statistics background: reproducibility in the social sciences/psychology
- Social media data analysis, machine learning, 
- complexity science approaches: network analysis, agent-based modeling


::: notes
- Define what “Digital Humanism” means to them
- Talk about the roots of “Digital Humanism” within their disciplinary traditions
- Talk about the challenges of “Digital Humanism” from their point of view
- Talk about the “methods” that ought to be part of an educational program in
“Digital Humanism”

::: notes
potentially use myths on misinfo, social media, emotions etc. as structure?

Story line: 
- Intro: like digital days
- There is emotion around news and misinfo - Jula study: true. Mostly anger. 

Questions I want to answer today: 
- Does it come from person or the news? 
- For the news:from that fact that its false/misinfo? (misinfo different from true info?)
- Or from emotion in the misinfo? 
(how big is it, who spreads/believes it?)

- Graz Survey here
Does it come from human's mood or from the stimulus?
Most people don't believe fake news. Just in our study? 
No: Extreme minority slide with other study results. 

Not sure where: How big of a problem is this? Untrustworthy news on social media. 
Who spreads misinfo? Majority/minority

What is it about the stimulus: accuracy or emotion? 
- Does it come from the misinfo? not much, Matching approach
- Does it come from emotion/humans? Yes - mirroring

Does it increase engagement? Yes. 

Is engagement driven by algorithms/social media design? 
Not much. Definitely not the cause, the big part of the problem. 

Open question: who spreads the misinfo, who is angry, and why - Jula's current work

What is the cause of misinfo? 
- Corruption
- Polarization
- Trust...

What do we need to address? 
- Education: empower individuals
- Redesign social media/algorithms?
- Solve problems in society, hard work

Empowering individuals: addressing social identity
- Apeksha intervention results

Can social media help? 
ABM Slide. 
- targeting politicians
Last part of project on algorithmic interventions - open question, but studies so far tell me that the effect won't be huge. 
Potential: focus on politicians, influencers, focus on extreme minority

Main conclusion:
- social media mirrors society, intensifies problems, but is not it's cause
- misinformation is a symptom of polarization, not it's cause
- We need to keep working on problems in the real world, with politics, as democracies, as citizens. 
- For this, we need to know which problems to focus on, and my feeling is that focusing only on social media is the wrong scapegoat, a distraction. 
- Use social media wisely, transparency, better algorithms, etc. but don't forget about the actual causes

Somewhere: these questions by them:  

3) What has happened to the early promises of digital technology freeing us from
traditional power structures? Was this expectation realistic or merely an illusion? 
we were hoping that social media would free us from power structures, who can share knowledge. 
What happened: loud people scream most, get most attention. Disappointed - now we need better concepts. 

6) Are we seeking better technology, a better society, or both? Is this primarily a power struggle or a technological one?
This is primarily a power struggle, social media as mirror, not cause. We can shape technology so it helps us fight power imbalance, but it's not easy.
7) How can we ensure digital technology supports rather than undermines democracy, the rule of law, and our shared societal values? We cannot???
8. What roles do regulatory frameworks play in creating a just society facilitated by digital humanism? Creating transparency. 
**Public Perception and Response
9. Why does digital technology provoke so much fear and concern in public and media discourses? Are these fears a form of "moral panic"?**
10. What is the responsibility of individual citizens in addressing or even countering the changes digital technology brings to their life?
Science important in correcting these misperceptions.

# Do emotions make people gullible? <br> Which emotions?

## Emotions & COVID-misinformation

- Actual true & false COVID-19 headlines from fact-checking websites & mainstream news sources in Austria in 2021
- Accuracy ratings (discernment)
- Emotions increase gulliblity to political news in the US <small> (Martel et al. [2020](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3) )</small>

# Emotions around news on social media

## How to identify misinformation?

::: columns
::: column
### Stories

- fact-checked news stories
- extreme and clearly false
- fringe communities
- small part of the misinformation problem
:::
::: column
### Sources

- all content published by a source, sources differ in trustworthiness/information quality
- selective, biased or misleading information, including grey area content
- broader engagement
:::
::::

::: notes
- multiple decisions of researchers
- It's hard to identify misinfo - focus on false stories
-  Grey area content, biased content spreads more widely, more dangerous
-  Broad definition of misinfo: not easy to identity
:::

## Observational social media analysis

### Objectives

1.  Collecting a large-scale & long-term data across the trustworthiness spectrum of news for German-speaking context

$\rightarrow$ **Tweets with links to news sources rated by NewsGuard**

2. Approximating causal inference to test the effects of misinformation on emotions

$\rightarrow$  **Matching strategy**

## Emotions in news posts on Twitter

- 8 emotions motion in discussions below tweets linking to news sources

![](images/emotions_panel_prop.svg)

- Machine learning model: pol_emo_mDeBERTa <small> (Widmann & Wich, [2022](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.15)), Macro F1=0.72 </small>

Lühring, Garcia,  Waldherr, Shetty, & Metzler (in prep.)
:::

::: notes
-   For each tweet, we then classified 8 distinct emotions and out-group references from text
-   This plot shows the covered time frame from October 2020 to March 2022 and we can already see that anger is overall much higher

:::
::: 

- Tweets assigned to 2 conditions based on similarity on covariates:
  - Political orientation, followers, following, time from post to response, emotions in post with the news
- Comparing conditions: effect of misinformation on emotions

::: notes
NewsGuard sets a threshold at a trustworthiness score at 60, such that sources below 60 are considered untrustworthy

We used this classification to create two conditions (trustworthy vs untrustworthy) - - then applied a nonparametric matching approach to balance the dataset based on a set of covariates

## How does misinformation elicit emotions? {.smaller}

Regressions to predict emotion in discussion from all emotions in news post

![](images/covariates_coeffs_emo_predicts_emo.svg)

### $\rightarrow$ Emotions in discussion mirror emotions in news post

## Conclusions from social media data

-   More anger in the context of misinformation

-   Emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial post $\rightarrow$ not trustworthiness!

- Misinformation likely includes more anger & conflict, leading to more engagement


# Can we change misperceptions? <br> $\rightarrow$ Interventions

::: notes
skipped the interventions part (4 slides) to manage 45-50 minutes
:::

## Changing beliefs is hard

::: incremental
- Beliefs are linked to social identity
- Beliefs are consistent with world-view
- Trust in the source of new information is crucial
- Process of belief change: 
  - Motivation to reflect: **first doubts**
  - Actually consuming new information 
  - Repeat often, over many sources & for associated beliefs

# Conclusion

## A new theoretical perspective on misinformation

::: incremental
- Emotions are **functional** - they don't make people stupid
- Emotions in misinformation attract attention & increase engagement
- Humans are not gullible: **motivated belief** vs. manipulation
- Motivated partisan **minority** shares misinformation
- Majority: **uninformed**, little news interest & silent
- Misinformation as **symptom** of real-world societal problems and polarization
