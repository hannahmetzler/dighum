## Digital Humanism & social media

Shaping digital technology in line with human values & needs <br><br>

### Psychology & computational social science: 

- Designing and using social media in ways that foster **individual** and **societal** well-being. 

  - mental health
  - extremism & polarization
  - echo chambers & misinformation

## Challenges for Digital Humanism in Computional Social Science

::: incremental
- Complex social issues with many influencing factors
  - Intuition vs. evidence
  - What are the root causes?
  - Which solutions address these?
- Social media companies: 
   - Transparency & cooperation

## Crucial methods and skills

::: incremental
- Asking good questions: solid evidence and theory building
- Awareness of cognitive & social biases
  - Transparency & Open Science
- Strong statistics skills: Real-world data & reproducibility
- Big data analysis (text, video...), machine learning, LLMs etc.
- Complexity science approaches: 
  - E.g. Network analysis, Agent-Based Modeling

:::

::: notes
- If we look in the "real world", where misinfo occurs on social media
- there indeed observe emotions around news, in particular anger

:::

# What is the origin of emotions around (untrustworthy) news?

::: notes
One main question I want to look at with you today is...
-  in the person (mood)?
- From the news?
- What about the news: wrong, or emotional/sensationalist?
:::

## Emotions: Mood vs. response to news

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
- Experiment with COVID-19 news headlines
- Austria 2021
- No effect of mood

::: fragment
- Response to false news: 
  - More anger
  - Less positive

## What about false news causes the emotion?

1) Causal effects of **misinformation**
    - untrustworthy compared to trustworthy information
2) Effects of **emotions** in the news
    - compared to emotionally neutral news

## 2) Effects of emotions in the news post

![](images/timeseries_external_events_panel.svg){width='800'}

$\rightarrow$ Emotions in discussion mirror emotions in news post

::: incremental
- Strongest predictor of **anger** in the discussion: 
    - **Anger** in the news post (influence of external events)
- Same pattern for all other emotions

- Compared to other emotions and trustworthiness

- EU registration of the first COVID-19 vaccines 
+ enforcement of measures against the spread of COVID-19 in December 2020
Floods in Germany in July 2021

:::

## Anger around misinformation

- Emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial post and less its trustworthiness

- More anger in the context of misinformation

### Why are people angry? Does anger make people easier to manipulate?

$\rightarrow$ Results from COVID-19 news headlines experiment
:::


## Why were people angry? 

![](images/curvi-linear.svg){width='1000'}

- Higher anger in people **good & bad** at recognizing false news
- Angry responses because most people **recognize** false news
- Anger arose when information contradicts existing beliefs

# Who believes and shares most misinformation?

This brings me to another crucial question: ...

- In our study: Educated, left-leaning sample
- majority did not believe COVID-19 false news
- But other studies? Social media?

## Misinformation as symptom of polarization

- Trust in institutions:
  - [Corruption](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2919) => more conspiracies
  - Not feeling represented
  - Frustration with real-world societal problems 
- Polarization of elites plays an important role ([2](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9216), [3]([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34769-6]), [4](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/types-sources-and-claims-covid-19-misinformation))

## What can we do?

- People not gullible & beliefs socially motivated
- Motivated minorities: hard to reach & convince

### Our approach

1) Psychological interventions as prevention: less polarized beliefs & groups
2) Algorithmic interventions: misinformation by politicians

## Algorithmic interventions

  - Even small effects can have large effects on exposure.

- Agent-Based Model = Computer simulation
- Model of US politicians' retweeting behavior
    - news trustworthiness

    - social groups (parties)

## Conclusions

::: incremental
- **Emotions** do not generally increase **irrationality**
- Emotions around news have a **social function**
- **Misinformation sharing** is socially motivated, not the result of gullibility
- Misinformation is a **symptom** of real-world societal problems that lead to polarization
- **Social media** reflects and distorts this polarization, but is likely not the main cause
- Solving **root causes** of polarization in the real-world

## Emotions & COVID-misinformation

- Accuracy ratings (discernment)
- Emotions increase gulliblity to political news in the US <small> (Martel et al. [2020](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-00252-3) )</small>

## ABM Set-up

![](images/ABM_setup.png)

::: notes
- from all politicians in our final dataset, random politicians are selected in each timestep, who post original tweets
- the tweets‘ characteristics correspond to actual tweets in our dataset
- the tweet spreads to the politician network of the posting politician
- the platform ranking algorithm then determines its ranking (we only model this when modelling interventions). In the base model, it is a reverse-chronological ranking only
- if the post makes it to the top n posts on the follower timeline, the following politician makes a retweeting decision. This is implemented through the logistic regression model
- if the post gets retweeted, it spreads to the retweeting politician‘s politician network and so on
- record the total number of politician retweets over the simulation run

Extended version
- retweets are increased by a factor to approximate total retweets (i.e., from general public), by increasing the retweet count of 1 by the politician‘s follower number
- introducing randomness through drawing from a binomial distribution
- this follower number is first reduced by overlaps with followers of previous tweeting and retweeting politicians of the same post
